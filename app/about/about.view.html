			<h1>myLoc8r</h1>

			<p>myLoc8r is my implementation of the Loc8r app built by Simon Holmes in his excellent book <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/getting-mean-with-mongo-express-angular-and-node">Getting MEAN with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node</a>, 1st edition.</p>

			<p>MyLoc8r is a location-based app that helps you find <strong>FICTIONAL</strong> coffee shops and cafes in your area that offer WiFi. By utilizing geolocation data from your browser, MyLoc8r retrieves a list of nearby locations through an API and presents them within the client app. All locations are conveniently displayed on a map, and a columnar view provides summary information, such as distance from your current location, available facilities, ratings, review counts, a snippet from the top review, and indications of whether each location is open or closed. Furthermore, the app includes filters to refine the displayed locations based on your desired facilities.</p>

			<p>For each location, you can access detailed information, including a location map, operating hours, and comprehensive reviews. The app also offers convenient controls to log in or register and to add your own review.</p>

			<p>My implementation differs from Simon's in the following ways:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>The back end API is build with <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/">Python Flask</a> instead of Node/Express</li>
				<li><a href="https://docs.mongoengine.org/">MongoEngine</a> is the Object-Document mapper.</li>
				<li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 5</a> is the front end toolkit.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a> is used instead of Google maps.</li>
				<li>Uses Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">unittest</a> - Unit testing framework and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/requests/">Requests</a> for API testing.</li>
				<li>All images and artwork used in MyLoc8r are sourced from <a href="https://www.freepik.com/">freepik.com</a>.</li>
